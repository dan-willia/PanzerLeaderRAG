" What is the time scale in PANZER LEADER, and what does each turn represent?", Each complete turn in PANZER LEADER represents six minutes of real time. (Reference: Section III. GENERAL OUTLINE OF PLAY),,,,
 What is the map scale in PANZER LEADER?, The scale of the mapboard is 1 hexagon = 250 meters. (Reference: Section II.B. THE MAPBOARD),,,,
" How many mapboard sections does PANZER LEADER include, and how are they identified?"," PANZER LEADER includes four mapboard sections, identified by letters A, B, C, and D. The letter identifier is located just above the fold line on each section. (Reference: Section II.B. THE MAPBOARD)",,,,
 What are the four phases in each player segment of PANZER LEADER?," The four phases in each player segment are: 1. Combat Phase, 2. Air Phase, 3. Movement Phase, and 4. Close Assault Phase. (Reference: Section IV. SEQUENCE OF TURNS)",,,,
 During which phase can a player execute minefield attacks?, Players execute minefield attacks during the Combat Phase. (Reference: Section IV.A.1. COMBAT PHASE),,,,
 Can a unit both fire and move in the same player segment?, No. Units which have fired (used their attack strength) in a combat phase of a player's segment may not move in that movement phase. (Reference: Section V.B.3. FIRED AND DISPERSED UNITS),,,,
 What is the cost in movement points for units traveling along roads?, All units move along roads at a cost of ½ movement point per road hex. (Reference: Section V.D.1. ROAD MOVEMENT RATE),,,,
 Under what condition can a vehicular unit NOT enter a road hex at the road movement rate?, A vehicular unit cannot enter a road hex at the road movement rate if the hex contains more than two other units. (Reference: Section V.D.3-4. STACKING LIMITATION),,,,
 What happens if a non-vehicular unit fails its die roll when attempting to enter a stream hex?," If unsuccessful (die roll of 4, 5, or 6), the unit may not move during that movement phase. (Reference: Section VII.K.2. NON-VEHICULAR REQUIREMENTS)",,,,
 What is the maximum number of units that can be stacked in one hex?, Both sides may stack a maximum of four units in one hex. (Reference: Section VI.A. MAXIMUM OF FOUR),,,,
 How are passenger and carrier units counted for stacking purposes?," When a unit is being transported by another unit, the passenger and the carrier are considered as one unit for stacking purposes. (Reference: Section VI.B. CARRIER AND PASSENGER TREATED AS ONE UNIT)",,,,
 Do minefield counters count towards stacking limits?," No, minefield counters do not count towards stacking limits. (Reference: Section VI.C. MINEFIELD COUNTERS DO NOT COUNT)",,,,
" What is the only way infantry (""I"") units can attack armored vehicle units?"," Close assault is the only way in which ""I"" units may attack armored vehicle units. (Reference: Section VII.E.7. ONLY WAY ""I"" UNITS MAY ATTACK ARMORED UNITS)",,,,
" When making a direct fire attack against units in a mixed stack, how do you determine which defense type to use?"," Determine what type of unit counter (armored or non-armored) predominates in the stack and treat the entire stack as that type of target. If the target stack is divided evenly between armored and non-armored unit counters, treat the whole stack as the type of target least favorable to the particular attacking unit(s). (Reference: Section VII.F.2.b. MIXED TARGET STACKS)",,,,
 What are the two modifications applied to overrun attacks?," 1) The combat odds are increased by one column in favor of the attacker, and 2) ""2"" is subtracted from the die roll results. (Reference: Section VII.D.4. INCREASED COMBAT EFFECT)",,,,
 How is the Line-of-Sight (LOS) determined in PANZER LEADER?, The Line-of-Sight is a perfectly straight line measured from the center of the firing unit's hex to the center of the target unit's hex. The LOS is traced by placing a straightedge on the mapboard so that it runs through the midpoint dots of the firing unit's hex and the target unit's hex. (Reference: Section VII.I. HOW TO DETERMINE THE LINE-OF-SIGHT/LINE-OF-FIRE),,,,
 Under what conditions can a unit always fire at a target regardless of obstacles or terrain?," No matter what the obstacle or the terrain, a unit may ALWAYS fire at a target to which it is directly adjacent (regardless of elevation). (Reference: Section VII.J.8. ADJACENT)",,,,
" When are units in woods or town hexes considered ""spotted"" and can be fired upon by non-adjacent units?"," Units are spotted if: 1) There is a friendly, undispersed unit adjacent to the defending enemy unit, or 2) The defending unit has fired while in the LOS of a friendly undispersed unit during the previous player segment and that friendly unit can still trace an unobstructed LOS to the target. (Reference: Section VII.L.1. WOODS AND TOWN HEX DEFENSE)",,,,
 What is unique about how indirect fire attacks are designated compared to direct fire?," Unlike direct fire attacks, the target hex for indirect fire must be designated at the beginning of the combat phase of the previous turn by secretly writing down the target hex coordinates and the firing units. (Reference: Section VII.C.3. IF ORDERS IN PREVIOUS TURN)",,,,
" What happens when all units spotting for indirect fire are destroyed, dispersed, or move away between designation and execution of fire?"," The fire may become scattered. To determine if the fire scatters, roll the die once and consult the Scatter Chart. A roll of 1-2 means fire hits normally, 3-5 means fire hits one of six adjacent hexes (determined by another roll), and 6 means fire is widely dispersed with no effect. (Reference: Section VII.C.8. SCATTERED)",,,,
"How do mines affect unit movement, and what happens to dispersed units on minefields?"," When a unit moves onto a mine, it must stop immediately. During the combat phase, the minefield attacks all units at 2-to-1 odds regardless of terrain, with each unit attacked separately. Units that survive can move off in their next turn. Dispersed units cannot move off minefields and must suffer another minefield attack in the following turn.",,,,
What is the process for an engineer unit to clear a minefield?," Minefield clearing is a four-turn process: On Turn 1, the engineer unit moves adjacent to the minefield. On Turn 2, the minefield counter is inverted at the beginning of the movement phase. On Turn 3, the engineer unit moves onto the minefield. On Turn 4, the minefield is removed at the beginning of the movement phase.",,,,
"How do ""Spotted"" markers work, and under what conditions can enemy units be spotted?"," ""Spotted"" markers are placed on enemy units that fire while in the line of sight (LOS) of friendly undispersed units. These markers remain until the enemy units are no longer in friendly LOS, or all friendly spotting units are dispersed, or the firing unit moves out of its initial firing hex into an unspotted town or woods hex.",,,,
"What is the maximum number of wrecks allowed in a single hex, and what happens if additional armored units are destroyed in that hex?"," The maximum number of wrecks allowed per hex is three. If an armored unit is destroyed in a hex already containing three wrecks, no additional wreck markers are placed; the unit is simply removed from the mapboard.",,,,
"How do fortifications affect the defense strength of units inside them, and what happens if a fortification is destroyed?"," Units in fortifications defend using only the defense strength of the fortification; their own defense strengths are ignored. Fortifications are treated as ARMORED targets. If a fortification is destroyed, any units inside it are also destroyed, and the fortification is replaced with a single wreck counter.",,,,
What's the difference between units placed ON TOP of a fortification versus units placed INSIDE a fortification?," Units INSIDE a fortification are placed UNDER the fortification counter and use the fortification's defense strength. Units ON TOP (outside) of a fortification and the fortification itself may be attacked individually or in combination like normal targets. Enemy units may be on top while friendly units are inside, creating unique combat situations.",,,,
What special capabilities does a Sherman Flail tank have compared to regular tanks?," A Sherman Flail tank can clear minefields. It does this by moving into the minefield hex, ending movement, and in the following movement phase, expending half its movement allowance to leave the hex. As the flail leaves the hex, the minefield is removed from the board. Flail tanks cannot be harmed by minefields.",,,,
What is the procedure for a Valentine Bridgelayer to place a temporary bridge?," The Valentine enters a stream hex and ends all movement. In the following movement phase, it expends three movement points leaving the stream hex. As the Valentine leaves, the tank bridge is placed on the stream hex, which can be used like a permanent bridge in the same movement phase.",,,,
"How do fighter-bombers execute attacks, and what are the limitations on their weapons usage?"," Fighter-bomber attacks are executed by moving the unit adjacent to the target hex, undergoing AA attacks if any, then resolving combat. Each FB unit can conduct bomb or rocket attacks only once per game and fire machine guns only four times per game. A fighter-bomber can't use multiple weapons in the same attack (e.g., machine guns and bombs).",,,,
What is the sequence for demolishing a bridge using engineer units?," To destroy a bridge, an engineer unit must remain on the bridge hex for three turns. On the fourth turn, it moves to an adjacent hex and rolls a die: 1-5 means success (bridge destroyed), 6 means failure. If it fails, the engineer can try again with fewer turns on the bridge: 1 turn (success on 1-2), 2 turns (success on 1-4), or 3 turns (success on 1-5).",,,,
What happens during an amphibious landing when a unit moves from a sea hex to a beach hex already occupied by a friendly unit?," If a unit moves from a sea hex to a beach hex already occupied by a friendly unit, all units in that hex are dispersed. No additional penalties accrue against units previously dispersed.",,,,
"What are the different methods for destroying a temporary bridge, and what happens to units on the bridge when it's destroyed?"," Temporary bridges can be destroyed by engineers (requiring only 2 turns on the bridge) or by artillery using direct or indirect fire. When a temporary bridge is destroyed by fire, any vehicular units and their passengers in that hex are destroyed, while non-vehicular units are unaffected. No wreck counters are placed in this situation.",,,,
"How do blocks affect movement, and can vehicles use road movement rates when entering a hex with a block?"," A unit may only enter a hex with a block if it begins its movement phase directly adjacent to that hex. Upon entering, the unit must stop and move no further that turn. In its next movement phase, it may move off the block at the normal rate. A block on a road negates the road movement rate, and vehicular units may not cross adjacent green hex sides when moving into a block-road hex.",,,,
What are the requirements for controlling a bridge hex according to the victory conditions?," A side controls a bridge hex if at least one friendly unit occupies, or is the last to enter or pass through, that bridge hex AND at least one hex on each side of the stream that is also ADJACENT to that bridge hex.",,,,
"How does Opportunity Fire work, and what fraction of movement must a unit expend in an enemy's line of sight to be targeted?"," Any enemy unit that expends ¼ (rounded DOWN) or more of its movement allowance continuously in LOS of a friendly unit may be attacked by that unit using direct fire. The unit is attacked as it enters the hex that constitutes ¼ of its movement in LOS, and its movement is halted until the attack is resolved.",,,,
"What are the restrictions for Quick-Time infantry movement, and what happens at the end of such movement?"," Infantry using Quick-Time speed can move 2 hexes but cannot enter slope, woods, stream, or town hexes (moving out is permitted). They cannot combine Quick-Time with road movement rate. If fired upon, they defend at half strength. At the end of movement, they must roll a die - on 4, 5, or 6, they are dispersed until the end of the current player segment.",,,,
What is the process for using naval support fire and how must it be planned?, Naval support fire can be used as direct fire against visible targets from any sea hex or as indirect fire with a ground unit sighting. Naval indirect fire attacks must be written down TWO turns in advance. All naval fire is (H) class and must be used in groups of 20 attack strength points minimum. It has unlimited range.,,,,
How do dispersed units affect the spotting of enemy units for indirect fire?," Units that are dispersed cannot spot for any type of fire. Regarding spotting for enemy units that have fired, the spotting unit cannot have been dispersed since the target unit fired.",,,,
What is a Panzerblitz Assault and how is it executed?," In a Panzerblitz Assault, German infantry units on armored vehicles may ""jump off"" in the hex immediately in front of a unit about to be overrun by those armored vehicles. The infantry may then close assault the units which were just overrun by the vehicles during the CAT phase.",,,,
"How do smoke shell concentrations (SSCs) affect line of sight, and how long do they last?"," SSCs obstruct LOS/LOF through the target hex at all elevations. They last for two consecutive turns after which they dissipate. The LOS/LOF is obstructed if the line traced between hexes intersects any part of the SSC target hex. Units can fire into or out of SSC hexes, but such hexes must be spotted to be fired upon.",,,,
