{"I. INTRODUCTION ": "PANZER LEADER is a realistic game simulating tactical  level combat on the Western Front during World War Two. The twenty game situations c over the gamut of combat encounters between the Allies and their German advers aries. Additionally, the open-ended design of the PANZER LEADER game system allows pl ayers to design and compile their own situations, thus creating unlimited game possibilities. Like its famous sister-game, PANZERBLITZ (Tactical Armored Combat on the Eastern Front, 1941-45), PANZER LEADER is not only an exciting game experience; i t is also a valuable source of comparative information illustrating the strengths an d weaknesses of the opposing German, British and American armies. IF YOU HAVE NEVERED PLAYED A WARGAME BEFORE, don\u2019t be overwhelmed by what may look like a lot of complicated rules. Someti mes more than a few words are required to precisely express a simple and easily understoo d concept. REMEMBER: These rules are based on common sense applications of  real-life events and operations. As such, their only purpose is to translate real-world occ urrences into the game format. It is not necessary to memorize these rules. Read the ru les once, play a practice game or two, and then re-read any sections that are unclear, bea ring in mind the experience gained in the practice games. Once the basics of movement and combat are understood, the finer points of the rules will fall into place as you gain ex perience. A WORD TO VETERAN AVALON HILL GAME PLAYERS: Although this game is based on the familiar PANZERBLITZ game-system, many su btle refinements and changes have been added. Read ALL of the rules before beg inning play, as even some of the \u201cstandard\u201d rules sections contain significant change s. ", "II. COMPONENTS ": "", "A. GAME EQUIPMENT ": "", "1. Mapboard ": "The mapboard is a two-dimensional representation of a t hree-dimensional space. The various terrain features, aside from affecting movemen t and combat may also effect the ability of attacking units to fire at given defending units by obstructing the Line-of-Site. Since the weapons used in this game are primarily direct- fire weapons, an attacking direct fire unit may not fire at any target which it cannot \u201cse e\u201d (i.e., trace an unobstructed line from the firing unit hex to the target hex). The terrain symbols on the map show the location of pot ential obstructions and the hex side symbols show in which direction fire is obstruc ted. These \u201cheavy\u201d hex side symbols are color-coded according to the type of obstruction they  represent. ", "2. German Counters ": "German die-cut counter sheet (192 pieces). ", "3. Allied Counters ": "Allied die-cut counter sheet (192 pieces). ", "4. Cards ": "Set of Situation and Player Aid Cards (seven cards). ", "5. Rules ": "Rules of Play and Designer\u2019s Notes booklet. ", "6. One Die ": "One Die", "B. THE MAPBOARD ": "The four-section mapboard represents a varied sampling of  typical terrain in France and Germany. Each section is identified by a letter (A,B, C , or D) located just above the fold line. The board is \u201cgeomorphic\u201d i.e. capable of being change d by re-arranging the four sections in a variety of juxtapositions. The long edge o f each mapboard section will line up with the long edge of any other section no matter which way they are joined together, except for the sea edge of board \u2018B\u2019. The short edges jo in with each other in a similar fashion. The scale of the mapboard is 1 hexagon = 250 meter s. Refer to the Terrain Effects Chart for a complete explanation of mapboard symbols and their effects on movement and combat. ", "C. THE PLAYING PIECES ": "The die-cut, cardboard pieces represent platoon or batter y-sized military units of different types (e.g., infantry platoons, tank platoons, assault gun p latoons, etc.), which are the playing pieces used in the game. Hereafter they will be r eferred to as \u201cunits\u201d or \u201cunit counters\u201d. The numbers on the unit counters represent tha t unit\u2019s capabilities with respect to movement, attack, defense and range of weapons. The oth er symbols or silhouettes identify what type of units the counters represent.   Note that all vehicle units are symbolized with an appropr iate silhouette and all other (non-vehicle) units are symbolized with standard militar y-planning symbols. Movement Allowance:  The basic maximum number of hexagons (hexes) which a unit may move in one turn, expressed as a certain number of movement points. In general each unit will expend one movement point from its movemen t (point) allowance to move a distance of one hex. Attack Strength:  The basic offensive power of a given unit, expressed as a certain number of attack strength points. ATTACK STRENGTH  WEAPONS TYPE  RANGE  SYMBOL  TYPE OF UNIT  DEFENSE STRENGTH  MOVEMENT ALLOWANCE  PICS NUMBER  Defense Strength:  The basic defensive strength of a given unit, expressed as a certain number of defensive strength points. Range:  The maximum effective distance (in hexes) that a unit\u2019 s attack strength can be used against enemy units. EXAMPLE:  a unit with a range of 8 could fire its weapons (use its attack strength) against an enemy unit\u2019s defens ive strength within that 8-hex range. ", "III. GENERAL OUTLINE OF PLAY ": "Each side maneuvers its forces (playing pieces) on the terrain map seeking to destroy enemy units or gain a specific territorial objective as  outlined on the Situation Cards. Players move their pieces and have combat by taking turns.  Each complete turn represents six minutes of real time. The forces in a given Situation may be unequal and one s ide may have a better chance of winning than the other, but it is primarily the skill of t he individual player which determines the outcome of the game. The chance element introduced by the use of the die-roll Combat Results Table is only that degree of chan ce consistently present in any real-life combat event. ", "IV. SEQUENCE OF TURNS ": "PANZER LEADER is played in turns. Each turn is divided in to two identical player segments: the Allied player segment and the German pl ayer segment. To avoid confusion, each player segment is further divided into four \u201cphases\u201d. ", "A. ALLIED PLAYER SEGMENT ": "", "1.

Half Hexes ": "The half-hexes on the outer edges of the board are con sidered playable and may be utilized as if they were complete hexagons. ", "B. HOW TO MOVE UNITS ": "", "1. Hexes ": "Movement is calculated in terms of hexes. Basically,  each unit expends one movement point (MP) of its total movement (point) allowance for  each hex it enters. To enter some types of hexes requires the expenditure of more than one  MP for each hex entered. A complete list of these \u201centry costs\u201d is found on the Terrain Effects Chart (TEC). ", "2. Voluntary ": "A player may make as many or as few attacks per turn as he desires (within the restrictions of the rules of combat). A player is ne ver forced to attack. Attacks are voluntary, never required. ", "3. Fired and Dispersed Units ": "Units which have fired (used their attack strength) in a co mbat phase of a player\u2019s segment may not move in that movement phase. \u201cDispers ed\u201d units may not move (see how to Have Combat and the Combat Results Table). ", "4. Moved Individually ": "Each unit is moved individually, tracing the path of movemen t through each hex in turn. Once a unit has completed its movement, it may not be ch anged, repositioned, or realigned. (A unit\u2019s movement is considered completed when  the player begins moving another unit). ", "5. At Least One Hex ": "Units with a movement allowance of \u201c1\u201d may move one he x per turn regardless of terrain. ", "6.

IF Orders in Previous Turn ": "Unlike direct fire attacks, the target hex must be designa ted at the beginning of the combat phase of the previous turn by secretly writing down the target hex coordincates and the firing units. (NOTE: Artillery units that are dis persed may NOT be targeted for indirect fire.) Such designated targets MUST be fired upon (i.e., the gun cannot change targets if the target hex turns out to be empty or if s omething better turns up) if the unit is to execute any attacks in that combat phase.

No Direct LOF Required ": "As the name implies, indirect fire differs from dir ect fire in that  the firing unit itself is not required to trace a \u201cdirect line of fire\u201d to the ta rget (i.e., it doesn\u2019t have to \u201csee\u201d the target hex). In order for certain artillery units to at tack a target by the indirect fire method, it is only necessary that another friendly unit  be able to \u201csee\u201d (have a \u201cdirect line of sight\u201d to) the target hex. In regards to woods and town hexes, a friendly unit must be adjacent to those hexes, or an enemy unit must have fir ed from those hexes for indirect fire attacks to be designated against them (see section  L. SPOTTING). ", "5.

For each indirect fire attack follow this procedure: ", "a)  Calculate Attack Strength ": "Calculate the number of strength points firing and DIVIDE  this total by the number of enemy UNIT COUNTERS in the target hex. Passenger-carr ier and fortifications (plus the units in them) count as one. 1 2 3 4 5 6 NORTH  ", "b)  Combat Odds ": "This reduced attack strength is then applied to each indivi dual target unit to create combat odds for (ad an individual attack on) each unit. The die is  rolled once for each target unit and the results applied accordingly. ", "c)  Example ": "EXAMPLE:  80 strength points fire indirectly at a targe t hex containing three German units: an engineer (DS = 10), an infantry (DS = 9), and an  81mm mortar (DS = 3). This computes as 80 \u00f7 3 (the number of defending units) = 26 (the reduced attack st rength).

Move Through Enemy Hex ": "To overrun a unit or stack of units, move the attacking armo red vehicle unit(s) straight through the enemy occupied hex, exiting into the hex DIREC TLY opposite the hex of entry. Overrunning units must stop in the \u201cexit hex\u201d and may move no further that movement phase. If the exit hex is occupied by enemy units , the overrun attack may not be made. Overrunning units may not move at the road rate,  but they may use roads to negate the effects of terrain. Overrunning units must have  sufficient movement points remaining to reach the exit hex.

HOW TO DETERMINE THE LINE-OF-SIGHT/LINE-OF-": "FIRE (LOS/LOF) For all practical purposes, the Line-of-Sight is equival ent to the Line-of-Fire. Essentially, the Line-of-Sight is a perfectly straight line measure d from the center of the firing unit\u2019s hex to the center of the target unit\u2019s hex. The dot in th e center of each hex represents the midpoint of that hex. The LOS is traced by placing a str aightedge on the mapboard so that it runs through the midpoint dots of the firing unit\u2019s he x and the target unit\u2019s hex. The line is exactly equivalent to the Line-of-Fire from the firing unit to the target unit.

SPECIAL:  It would NOT block the LOS/LOF i f it were a brown hex side connected to an orange hex side. ", "b)  Bisecting a Corner ": "The defender is given the benefit of the doubt if the st raightedge cuts exactly through the \u201ccorner\u201d of a hex where a symbol side and a non-symbol side meet. Note that the heavy symbols do not always extend to the very ends of the he x sides. The LOS/LOF is blocked, however, through the entire hex side even if it i s traced throught that part not covered by the heavy symbol color. ", "2. Slope Or Hilltop To Ground level ": "When firing FROM a slope or hilltop TO a ground level target , the Line-of-Sight is obstructed if the target unit is directly behind a town hex or a green hex side. \u201cDirectly behind\u201d means the intended target is either adjacent to a  town hex such that part of the town hex blocks the Line-of-Sight, or that a green he x side forms part of the target unit\u2019s hex such that it blocks the LOS.
